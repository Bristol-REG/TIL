# Today I Learned

This repo contains TILs from the team at the [Jean Golding Institute](https://www.bristol.ac.uk/golding/).

> [!TIP]  
> TIL stands for "today I learned". We constantly learn new things that would be useful for others (including our future self!) to see.

[We welcome contributions](#contributing-tils) from the community.

TILs are public domain ([CC0](LICENSE)) unless otherwise noted. Any referenced content may have its own license.

This repo uses a [Python script](build_readme.py), triggered by GitHub Actions, to automatically generate the table of contents and index of TILs in this README. This system was inspired by the TILs of [Lacey Henschel](https://github.com/williln/til) and [Simon Willison](https://github.com/simonw/til).
